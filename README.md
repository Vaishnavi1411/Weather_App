# Weather_App

I have used weather API for fetching the data from the Open Weather Map website by generating an API key, and then create a configuration file to store the key. 
The GUI app will tell the current weather of a particular city along with temperature details like Wind,Pressure,Humidity and Description.

Modules required:
1] Tkinter: It is a built-in python library for making GUI using tkinter toolkit.

2] Requests: It is a library which helps in fetching the data with the help of URL. 

3] Geopy=geopy is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services.
4] TimezoneFinder=This is a fast and lightweight python package for looking up the corresponding timezone for given coordinates on earth entirely offline.
5] Datetime=The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.
6]Pytz=It brings the Olson tz database into Python and thus supports almost all time zones. This module serves the date-time conversion functionalities and helps user serving international clientâ€™s base. It enables time-zone calculations in our Python applications and also allows us to create timezone aware datetime instances.
